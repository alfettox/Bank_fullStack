# Project Name

## Overview

This project is a web application that leverages MongoDB Atlas as the database, a Go backend, React for the frontend, and a Node.js server. It provides a template for building a modern full-stack web application.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB Atlas**: MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed cloud database service. In this project, it is used to store and manage the application's data. You can set up MongoDB Atlas and configure your database connection in your Go backend.

- **Go Backend**: The backend of the application is built using the Go programming language. It handles data processing, serves API endpoints, and interacts with the MongoDB database.

- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Solution**: To resolve CORS issues (which occur when your frontend and backend have different origins), we've used a package or middleware to handle CORS headers. This allows the frontend, which is hosted on one domain (e.g., `localhost:3000`), to make requests to the backend on another domain (e.g., `localhost:8080`) without encountering browser security restrictions. This middleware is typically added to the Go backend to enable cross-origin requests.

- **React Frontend**: The frontend of the application is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's responsible for the user interface, presenting data, and interacting with the user.

- **server.js**: The `server.js` file is a Node.js server that could be used to serve the React frontend and act as a proxy to the Go backend. This setup can help avoid CORS issues by allowing both frontend and backend to be hosted on the same domain or port, thus simplifying the communication between them. The server.js file can also be used for additional server-side functionality or routing.

## Project Structure

- **`bank-backend`**: This directory contains the Go backend of the application. It's where you define your routes, handle database interactions, and implement business logic.

- **`bank-frontend`**: The React frontend is stored in this directory. You'll find components, views, and other frontend-related code here.

- **`server.js`**: This Node.js file can serve as your server to host the React frontend and handle requests to the backend. It's often used to address CORS issues.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Backend Setup**:
   - Ensure you have Go installed.
   - Set up MongoDB Atlas and configure your database connection in the Go backend.
   - Install Go dependencies using `go mod tidy` and `go get`.
   - Run the Go backend server using `go run main.go`.

3. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the `bank-frontend` directory.
   - Install frontend dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
   - Start the React development server using `npm start` or `yarn start`.

4. **Server.js Setup** (Optional):
   - If needed, update the `server.js` file to match your specific server and routing requirements.
   - Run the Node.js server using `node server.js`.

5. Access the Application:
   - Open your web browser and access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.
   - Ensure that the frontend communicates with the backend without CORS issues.
